# Mapping of Analytical Constructs to Survey Questions # 

This document provides the mapping between the theoretical constructs in our model and the exact survey questions used to measure them. It also indicates each question’s code, the urban context(s) in which it was asked, and its role in the analysis (independent variable, mediator, moderator, or dependent variable).
